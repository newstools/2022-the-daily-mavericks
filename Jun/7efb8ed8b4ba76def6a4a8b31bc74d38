After almost 5,500 pages spread over six parts, the Zondo Commission report has recommended the investigation of former president Jacob Zuma on possible corruption charges in relation to just one matter. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) was advised to consider potential criminal charges against Zuma only in the findings of Part 3 of the State Capture report, released in March, and only in relation to his dealings with the private company Bosasa. Despite the fact that Zuma came in for extremely harsh criticism in every one of the six parts of the report, Chief Justice Raymond Zondo and his team appear to have concluded that only the corruption around Bosasa might provide sufficient evidence to mount a criminal case against Zuma for his role in State Capture. In the final parts of the report released on Wednesday, however, the name of JZ’s son Duduzane Zuma joins his father’s on the NPA’s to-do list. Suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule is also recommended for possible criminal investigation — as is President Cyril Ramaphosa’s current Farmgate adversary, former spy boss Arthur Fraser. All three are regarded as being aligned with the ANC’s Radical Economic Transformation (RET) faction seeking to unseat Ramaphosa from the ANC presidency at the party’s electoral conference at the end of this year. Joining them on the list are a number of former executives of state-owned enterprises — together with the Guptas.
