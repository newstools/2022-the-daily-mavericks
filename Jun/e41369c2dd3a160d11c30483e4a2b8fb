Cubist Abstraction is an art form that many South African artists implement in their practice. This type of artmaking uses geometric and stylised forms to combine non-objective compositions or produce figural representations. Initiated by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in 1907 and ending with Josef Albers’ geometric abstraction, who died in 1976, the style is extremely broad. A particular characteristic of this movement was the influence of African material culture on the stylisation of the figure, seen clearly in Abstract Figure by Cecil Skotnes (estimates R 7 000 – 9 000) or Ezrom Legae’s Torso (estimates R 4 000 – 6 000). Abstract Expressionism is a particular term assigned to new forms of Abstract Art developed by American artists Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning working in the 1940s and 1950s. It is often characterized by gestural brushstrokes or mark-making and the impression of spontaneity is evident in the work by George Boys, titled Touch (estimates R 8 000 – 12 000). Tachisme is a related term used to describe the non-geometric abstract art that developed in Europe in the same period. The auction presents a special focus on artist Christo Coetzee, who was hugely influenced by the European abstract movement of Tachisme, seen referenced in his work El Cordobés (estimates R 5 000- 7000), along with additional influences by the Japanese Gutai Art Association, of which his work Yellow Baroque Form (estimates R 80 000 – 120 000) is a striking example. These styles continue to impact artmaking in South Africa as Contemporary artists continue this trend, visible in the unique geometric compositions of Esther Mahlangu’s Untitled (2007) (estimates R 15 000 – 20 000), and Maja Marx Black Block (estimates R 30 000 – 50 000); the spontaneous mark-makings of Zander Blom in 1.269 [Untitled] (estimates R 40 000 – 60 000); the collage and assemblage in White Flag (Squall) by Julia Rosa Clarke (estimates R 10 000 – 15 000); and the meticulously hand-drawn abstract forms in Tone 6 and Tone 9 by Paul Edmunds (each with estimates R 15 000 – 20 000). To conclude the sale, Strauss & Co is proud to support established artist Jill Trappler’s latest initiative, The Orange Art Project (OAP).
