By Anna Mehler Paperny Alek Minassian was found guilty last year of murdering 10 people and attempting to murder 16. One of the 16 later died in connection with injuries she suffered in the attack, and a judge said on Monday she considered the woman the 11th victim. Minassian’s sentencing was delayed pending a Supreme Court case on another matter to determine the constitutionality of consecutive parole ineligibility periods. Minassian will be eligible for parole in 25 years. (Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; editing by Jonathan Oatis)
