Tracker has always embraced technology and added to existing offering by designing services to be more than just a theft protection device, so that no matter what your business’s needs are, you can rest assured knowing that you’re getting there in a smarter, safer and more cost-effective way. It has recently added Tracker Track and Dispatch IQ, Dashboards and Analytics, and Tracker AI Dashcam to its list of business solutions for those running a fleet. It’s turning information about how a vehicle is used into services that help a business owner to get its fleet to where it’s going in a smarter and more cost-effective way. Recent events in South Africa have further highlighted the need for businesses to take advantage of technological advancements and have electronic, and as far as possible, automated systems in place to monitor daily processes and assets in the supply chain environment. While human intelligence and intuition can be beneficial, manual processes are tedious and prone to inefficiencies. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1291307 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gettyimages-1165547094-170667a.jpg" alt="" width="509" height="339" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gettyimages-1165547094-170667a.jpg 509w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gettyimages-1165547094-170667a.jpg?resize=480,320 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gettyimages-1165547094-170667a.jpg?resize=350,233 350w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /> “With advanced planning, optimisation and execution management, businesses small and large can realise improved operating efficiencies and lower operating costs,” says Kobus Visagie, Executive: Business Solutions at Tracker South Africa. “There has never been a better time to harness the intelligence from the information provided by vehicle telematics and related software and use it to place your business a cut above the rest.” Fleet management prioritises keeping a fleet operation running efficiently, without any disturbances or glitches. Therefore, having the option to use a smart device that utilises artificial intelligence-based technology can offer a fleet owner seamless control of their business, and ramp up their business’ performance. By simply supplying analytics and insights, Tracker can provide business owners full visibility on all aspects of their fleet management so that they are able to make decisions quickly and with confidence. Using artificial intelligence-based software, Tracker is affording fleet owners an opportunity to optimise deliveries by knowing exactly where every driver is every minute of the day, being kept informed on which vehicles are going to need services and when, and even being able to monitor driver attentiveness using on-board AI Dashcams. Visagie continues, “We have developed a dashboard that offers the true story.  Our fleet management services offer a holistic overview of the entire fleet process, factoring in everything from the traffic data to individual driver habits.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1291310 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg" alt="" width="5580" height="3487" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg 5580w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=480,300 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=720,450 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=1280,800 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=1600,1000 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-97559951.jpg?resize=350,219 350w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /> Technology can drive efficiencies through people by allowing resources, processes and vehicle monitoring to be managed and monitored centrally, providing full visibility regarding all aspects of the supply chain. A technology-enabled business can now establish “control tower” capability via a digital twin – a virtual simulation model of real-world supply chain activities. It is used to analyse supply chain dynamics and to predict process success via real-time data of planned and released work and sales orders, deliveries, pickups, ePod’s and approvals. Aside from the efficiencies and impact on the bottom line, the greatest benefit of updating your business with the likes of artificial intelligence-based software services such as Tracker’s is undoubtedly peace of mind. “Business owners can sleep better at night knowing that their fleet, their drivers, and their business is taken care of, 24-7. Non-negotiable.” The benefits of implementing Trackers’ new artificial intelligence-based services include: For more information, head to:
