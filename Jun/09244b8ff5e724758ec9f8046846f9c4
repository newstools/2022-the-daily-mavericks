An almost 3% slump in a key gauge of the greenback since a high point in mid-May suggests a rebound in developing markets, which tend to outperform the rest of the world in the months following a cyclical dollar peak, according to Caesar Maasry and Jolene Zhong. “Weak US dollar cycles tend to bode positively for emerging-market assets,” they wrote in a Thursday note to clients, pointing to attractiveness in the MSCI China Index and early-cycle emerging markets in Southeast Asia.

A three-times leveraged China stock ETF saw a record volume surge Tuesday and Wednesday, almost six times the daily average. The Indonesian rupiah has advanced around 0.6% this week, touching a one-month high, while the South Korean won and offshore yuan have both gained 1.3%. Of course, it isn’t a perfect science. Typically emerging-market growth data “bottoms” around a peak in the dollar, and equity valuations often trade at greater discounts to the S&P 500, according to Goldman.

It’s “an unusual occurrence.” Goldman also sees the yen outperforming as US recession risks rise. “It works as a safe haven when US demand is slowing, the US economy is going into recession or growth is coming down,” Zach Pandl, strategist, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “We really think that the Japanese yen is the safest currency to be in in this highly uncertain, volatile both macro and market environment.” BM
