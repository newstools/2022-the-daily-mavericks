Squid Game is officially coming back for Season 2! pic.twitter.com/4usO2Zld39 — Netflix (@netflix) June 12, 2022 “Squid Game”, in which a group of indebted people compete in deadly versions of childhood games to win money as super-rich VIPs watch, was Netflix’s biggest launch ever. The series boosted the popularity of Korean content worldwide and prompting global players including Walt Disney, Apple and Warner Media to invest in local-language titles and original series to lure subscribers. Netflix is betting that a second season may help stymie this year’s 70% slump in shares after announcing in April that it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter, the first time it has shed customers since 2011. The company projected it will shrink by another 2 million customers in the second quarter. BM
