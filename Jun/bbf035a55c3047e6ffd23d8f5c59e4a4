 Perhaps the never-say-die attitude comes from more than a year of boardroom drama and angst. At one stage players’ salaries were paid late and they never knew if there would be a next week for a union teetering on the brink of financial Armageddon. The Western Province Rugby Football Union (WPRFU) was placed under administration last September and the Stormers faced a real possibility of collapse. The best script writers could not have come up with a plot like this.  After being stopped in their tracks in a sloppy first half, the Stormers sharpened up their kicking game after the break and posed far more testing questions of the Bulls. The game opened up with better contestable kicking and the Stormers were always favourites once the match was allowed to breathe following a claustrophobic opening stanza.  But Vorster was in full pilot fish mode and snapped the ball up and barged over from close range to dampen the party atmosphere enveloping the DHL Stadium.  In truth though, after the early score the Bulls were content to hold the home side at arms’ length with their smothering defence and superior lineout. The fact that the Stormers’ first foray into the Bulls’ 22-metre came in the 31st minute, underlined their initial plight. They simply could not build enough pressure on to force the Bulls into errors.  It was the Stormers’ third win over the Bulls in the competition and none have been by more than a single score. The men from Pretoria might have fallen short on the night but they are also a team that will improve and develop. With the Boks as the top Test team in the world and the South African provincial game in such good shape, exciting years lie ahead for the sport.
