Alarmed by the surge in energy costs spurred by Moscow’s assault, Washington and allies have announced plans to sell almost a quarter-of-a-billion barrels from strategic petroleum reserves. With the move supported by France, the U.K. and others, that’s prompted a collapse in once-elevated time spreads. Measured global stockpile releases can be used “as an opportunity to sanction Russian crude oil explicitly by the EU, U.S., Japan, and South Korea, without blowing up the oil price, thus leading to actual economic pain for Russia,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AB in Oslo. Flooding the market with releases to crash the price “is, of course, another option, though a very unpredictable one,” he said.

Cities are facing severe restrictions, which are curbing mobility and energy consumption. –With assistance from Ben Sharples, Ranjeetha Pakiam and Sarah Chen.
