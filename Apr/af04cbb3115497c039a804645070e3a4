Apr 12, 2022, 10:45 PM – Updated on Apr 12, 2022, 11:45 PM Musk didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to comment on the suit. The investor said that, when Musk filed the form revealing his Twitter stake, company shares rose 27%, from $39.31 on April 1 to $49.97 on April 4. Rasella is seeking to represent a class of investors who sold Twitter shares from March 24 to April 1. The case is Rasella v. Musk, 22-cv-03026, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a judge to hold Elon Musk in contempt for violating last year’s settlement with the agency, raising a new round of regulatory issues for the embattled Tesla Inc. CEO. Twitter Inc. said Elon Musk has decided not to join its board, a stunning twist to a week-long saga that’s captivated the tech community and touched off renewed speculation about the company’s future. The chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX has called out Twitter for “failing to adhere to free speech principles” and the need to root out cryptocurrency scams that are prolific on the social media platform, which was co-founded by his friend Jack Dorsey.
