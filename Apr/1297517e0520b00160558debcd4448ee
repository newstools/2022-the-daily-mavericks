Over 100 farm women marched to the Paarl Magistrates’ Court and Drakenstein Municipality on Tuesday, 26 April to draw attention to a looming surge in evictions from farms in the Western Cape. In its memorandum, Women on Farms Project (WFP), the organiser of the march, said farm evictions are likely to increase once the State of Disaster ends. “When eviction cases already on the court rolls are effected, thousands of farm workers and their families face homelessness or living in overcrowded informal settlements,” the memorandum read. WFP called for: The memorandum was addressed to the Chief Magistrate at Paarl Magistrates’ Court, Drakenstein Municipality Mayor Conrad Poole, Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola, Minister of Police Bheki Cele, and the Human Rights Commission. Neither the senior magistrate nor the mayor came out to receive the memo. During the march, farm women chanted “down with evictions” and carried placards that read “Courts STOP granting eviction orders” and “ESTA doesn’t protect farm workers”. The Extension of Security of Tenure Act (ESTA) outlines the conditions under which a farm dweller can legally remain on a rural landowner’s property and also outlines the process for a landowner to legally evict a farm dweller. But according to Carmen Louw of WFP, farm dwellers are not adequately protected. “On the one hand they implement ESTA to effect evictions, but they’re not using ESTA to protect the rights of farm workers.” Farmers who evict farm dwellers illegally are rarely prosecuted or held accountable, she said. WFP had seen evictions of farm dwellers without court orders, as well as “constructive evictions” where the farmer switches off the electricity or water to force farm dwellers to move out. Joanne Johannes, a farmworker from Simondium, said: “We are the people who, during Covid, went out to work on the farmlands in order to feed South Africa and to keep the economy going.” Ida Plaatjies, who lives on a farm in Simondium where she used to work, said at 62 years old she doesn’t even have a small piece of land to grow vegetables that her family could live off. “We have nothing,” she said. Jacqui Samson, executive director of Planning, Development and Human Settlements at Drakenstein Municipality, said in response to GroundUp questions that the municipality does not support evictions and “has played its part in all eviction matters where the courts ordered it to provide alternative accommodation”. “In line with the municipality’s temporary housing assistance policy, where ordered to provide alternative accommodation to evictees, Drakenstein Municipality provides them with a 24-square-metre structure in a municipal emergency housing site,” said Samson. <img style="display: none; width: 1px;" src="https://thirdpartyhits.groundup.org.za/counter/hit/dailymaverick/2022-04-27-thousands-farm-workers-face-eviction-end-national-state-disaster-activists-warn/" alt="" /> The plight of a farm-dweller family evicted from their home on a wine farm in Paarl this week put the spotlight back on the growing tension between the legality and morality question relating to farm evictions. Farmworkers and farm dwellers continue to face legal evictions in a country desperately trying to stabilise its economy – and their patience is wearing thin. Farmworkers across the Western Cape are still facing evictions from farms with up to 20,000 people facing evictions in one municipality. While South Africa observed Human Rights Day on 21 March, farmworkers question when their rights will be respected and enforced by the president and the Ministry of Rural Development…
