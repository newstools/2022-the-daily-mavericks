After going on a spending binge in January, South Africans were hardly flocking to the shops in February. Retail trade sales that month fell 0.9% year on year, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) said on Wednesday. This compared with market expectations of a 1.1% increase. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, retail trade was down 0.5% from January. Muted demand pressures are no surprise in an economy with an unemployment rate of over 35% that is also grappling with slowly rising interest rates and consumer inflation that is close to 6% and expected to remain on the boil for some time in the face of surging food and fuel prices. Still, other data sets have pointed to a reasonable start to 2022 for the South African economy, which grew by 4.9% last year after contracting by 6.4% in 2020. On the retail front, sales rose by 6.4% last year after contracting by 7.1% in 2020 and had got off to a flying start in January 2022, climbing by 7.7% year on year. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1235914" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-13-at-17.09.55.png" alt="" width="720" height="177" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-13-at-17.09.55.png 1426w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-13-at-17.09.55.png?resize=480,118 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-13-at-17.09.55.png?resize=768,188 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-13-at-17.09.55.png?resize=720,177 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-13-at-17.09.55.png?resize=1280,314 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-13-at-17.09.55.png?resize=350,86 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> So, it could be the case that February was just a blip and the March read could be stronger. New vehicle sales, for example, have been robust, which is partly a reflection of pent-up demand. And the BankservAfrica Economic Transaction Index (Beti), a measurement of economic transactions between South Africa’s banks calculated by Economists.co.za, reached an all-time high in March of 135.9 index points. “The Beti figures correspond to the robust new vehicle sales, the Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index, and other well-performing economic sectors,” said BankservAfrica. Other indicators paint a decidedly mixed economic start to 2022. Output in South Africa’s manufacturing sector grew by a paltry 0.2% on a year-on-year basis in February and fell on a monthly basis by 1.1%. And domestic retail fuel prices have hit record highs while food inflation remains elevated, not least because of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The South African consumer is becoming hard-pressed. In such an environment, expect consumers to think twice before they open their wallets. DM/BM While the drums of war were beating in eastern Europe, it seems that Cupid’s arrow was zinging around South Africa. According to FNB, South Africans went on a Valentine’s Day spending splurge. Winners included restaurants, spas and cinemas – and good on them after the pandemic pounding they have taken. It is likely that SA’s GDP grew less than 5% in 2021 in the wake of July’s riots. South African consumer inflation slowed in January while growth in retail trade sales picked up pace in December, data published by Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday. Both trends are at least green shoots amid a pretty barren economic landscape.
