On Monday 11 April at 4pm, the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research is hosting an online seminar centred on a paper titled “Macroeconomic determinants of South Africa’s post-apartheid income distribution”. The seminar will be presented by the paper’s author, Adam Aboobaker. The paper places developments in post-apartheid income distribution within key macroeconomic developments and debates. An argument is made that the deterioration of the wage share between 2000 and 2008 is better explained by “factors associated with the commodity boom, rather than those associated with neoliberalism”, according to the abstract of the paper. “The conventional wisdom underlying progressive advocacy for a better performing and more equitable macroeconomy are not in keeping with the data presented here, nor a closer reading of the policy debates it has drawn inspiration from,” according to the abstract. “This calls for reorienting the focus of radical policy critique from insufficient state allocation of resources toward social policy to a critique concerning the post-apartheid state’s failure to mobilise the necessary resources to drive forth rapid structural transformation.” Those wishing to join the seminar should first read the paper here.

The United Nations (UN) General Assembly declared 12 April the International Day of Human Space Flight in 2011, to celebrate each year at the international level the beginning of the space era for all people, thereby reaffirming the contribution of space science and technology in achieving sustainable development goals, according to the organisation’s information page on the event. The observance is further intended to recognise the importance of space science to the well-being of countries and peoples and ensure the realisation of the goal to maintain peace in outer space. “From the very beginning of the Space Age, the United Nations recognised that outer space added a new dimension to humanity’s existence. The United Nations family strives continuously to utilise the unique benefits of outer space for the betterment of all humankind,” stated the UN. At 9.30am on Tuesday 12 April, the Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) will be holding its sixth just transition framework community consultation at Thabo Moorosi Multi-Purpose Centre in Mothibistad, Kuruman, Northern Cape. The commission was established in 202o by President Cyril Ramaphosa to advise government and all social partners on South Africa’s response to climate change. It aims to develop pathways to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society. The PCC began to develop a “Just Transition Framework”, being a multipronged practical policy strategy to guide the implementation of necessary interventions, in late 2021. The process involves a series of policy briefs on key questions, public dialogues and sectoral engagements. A livestream of Tuesday’s event will be available on the PCC website, as well as on Facebook. At 10.30am on Tuesday, the Hanns Seidel Foundation, together with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), is hosting a seminar, titled “How to extinguish South Africa’s flames of xenophobia”. “Organised groups such as Operation Dudula increasingly target African immigrants in South Africa. Building on myths about foreign nationals and anti-migrant attitudes, widespread violence is becoming more likely. An outbreak similar to the deadly 2008 xenophobic violence that spread rapidly across the country must be averted,” according to the event description. This requires civil society and government to proactively counter this trend and extinguish the flames of xenophobic sentiment. The chairperson is Anthony Kaziboni, head of research in the Institute for the Future of Knowledge at University of Johannesburg. The speakers include Godfrey Mulaudzi, researcher for Justice and Violence Prevention at ISS; Dr Dale McKinley of Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia; and Elize du Toit, deputy director in the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, South Africa.

Chagas disease affects mainly poor people without access to healthcare or a political voice. The progress of the disease is slow, often showing an asymptomatic clinical course, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) information page on the event. “Without treatment, Chagas disease can lead to severe cardiac and digestive alterations and become fatal. Raising awareness of the disease is essential to improve the rates of early treatment and cure, together with the interruption of its transmission,” stated the WHO. The theme of World Chagas Disease Day for 2022 is “finding and reporting every case to defeat Chagas disease”, according to the WHO. Many countries have low detection rates and significant barriers to accessing adequate healthcare. There are about six to seven million people infected with Chagas disease worldwide, with 10,000 deaths every year. DM/MC ‘Macroeconomic stabilisation’ – buried within that seemingly logical phrase is a bold claim: our macroeconomic framework is secure and tight, all we need to worry about now are the microeconomic details. If this was an appropriate approach, why then are there more poor South Africans today than there were in… If South Africans really care about the land question then we should ask ourselves whether we know the full cost of turning the clock back to a time when farming was a much easier occupation and are happy about who will pay those costs.
