Often, healthcare practitioners do not have knowledge of the existence of intersex persons, let alone what affirming healthcare services for these individuals should look like. “These trends within the public health sector led to intersex persons and their guardians receiving pathologising information that promotes IGM (Intersex Genital Mutilation) instead of alternative affirming information,” according to the event description. “Poor health systems in Africa also lead to intersex people being unable to access their health records, a provision that is supported by law but is often not accessible in healthcare facilities.” Speakers at the event include Crystal Hendricks of Iranti in South Africa; Obioma Chukwuike of Intersex Nigeria; James Karanja of the Intersex Persons Society of Kenya; Mphatso Satya of the Intersex Society of Namibia; and Ronie Zuze of the Intersex Community of Zimbabwe.

As South Africa is a water-scarce country, this trade-off may expose inequalities in our society, thus having social justice implications.

Let’s promote harmony with nature and the Earth,” stated the UN. <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1239743" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg 1813w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg?resize=480,270 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg?resize=1600,900 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CSW-Apr19-Poster6.jpg?resize=350,197 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> On Friday at 1pm, Code for Africa is hosting a WanaData webinar on “Corruption and anti-corruption strategies by Corruption Watch”.
