Things are changing fast and humanity is hurtling towards an unpredictable future. We’re not stable in our lives, professions, societies, cultures. The rhythm of change often leaves us feeling lost and directionless. Despite understandable apprehension about what the new millennium is bringing, humanity seems to be willingly building weaponry with the potential to upend our lives and render us a failed civilisation. We created the internet in the dying decades of the second millennium, and followed it with an even more intrusive and potentially deadly Pandora’s box: social media. To older generations, the speeding clock of change is almost unrecognisable. Our collective positive minds were supposed to link together in a superpowerful humanity, but we only succeeded in connecting our ids into weapons more dangerous than nuclear and thermonuclear bombs. In this world in terrifying flux, Real Journalists walk a precarious path between staying true to their ethics and role in society on one side and, on the other, embracing new technology that, theoretically, can help them deliver on their mandate to keep people informed and democracies alive. But times are tough. The framework that built modern journalism as the Fourth Estate of democracy is melting. What used to be the rule, today is merely optional. Once, when bad guys got exposed, it was the end for them. Today, it is just the start of another money-making cycle. Honesty, truthfulness, integrity and incisiveness work less powerfully when the bad guys are shameless and society is confused about its values. In this earthquakey world, the media should be the remaining spine, strong enough to hold values in place until the storm is over; the voice that can clearly and loudly say, this is good and this bad, and most people instinctively agree. We should be an anchor in choppy seas, a safe haven in the storm. And yet. And yet. With growing alarm, I see more and more of ‘us’ forgetting what we stand for, why we gathered to deliver on our mandate and what role we should be playing. I put together a few thoughts, in no particular order, to help remind ourselves why we, the remaining media, are still here and why we chose to be journalists, and not reality TV stars: There are many more points one can make about this dying species. We might only realise how crucial Real Journalists were for us when they’re not around anymore.

Instead, it would follow the principles expressed in any ecosystem found in the natural world: i.e., that it is organically counterproductive for any species to bring about the demise of… The notion that the climate crisis is a ‘human’ problem is too general, too broad and ultimately misguided. This existential threat presented to our species has been manufactured by a small fraction of our species, in whose hands power and wealth is concentrated. Our analysis of the world has to grapple with the sources of power – old and new – and the systems which drive abuse. We need an ambitious plan to tackle the big challenges, including the unholy trinity of inequality, technology and climate.
