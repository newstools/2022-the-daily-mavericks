The team was being “held in the town of Manhush, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Mariupol,” ICRC spokesperson Jason Straziuso told Reuters. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the Red Cross team was being held by “the occupation authorities”. Read full story Straziuso declined to give details of who was holding the team, saying only that they had been detained by police. “It’s not a hostage situation,” he added, saying the ICRC was talking with all parties to clarify the situation and seek their release. The Red Cross team had been aiming to reach the besieged city of Mariupol on Monday and evacuate some of the remaining residents who are lacking basic supplies. It was their fourth such attempt since Friday. The organisation withdrew its team, which included staff members with young children, from the port city in mid-March after they ran out of aid. LVIV, Ukraine, March 31 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces are preparing for new Russian attacks in the southeast region where Moscow's guns are now trained after its assault on the capital Kyiv was repelled, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with Nato member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a local official said, in an escalation of the war to the west of the country as intense fighting was reported elsewhere. Ukraine appealed to Russia on Tuesday to allow humanitarian supplies into Mariupol and to let desperate civilians out of the besieged city which President Volodymr Zelenskiy said had been devastated by Russian bombardments.
