In March, CISA said there was “evolving intelligence” that Russia was exploring options for potential cyberattacks. Read full story Last week, it said advanced hackers have shown they can take control of an array of devices that help run power stations and manufacturing plants, although that alert did not name Russia, which routinely denies it carries out cyberattacks. Read full story Wednesday’s statement also warned of the potential for cybercrime groups which have pledged to support the Russian government to carry out digital extortion attacks against Western targets. “These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups have threatened to conduct cyber operations in retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or the Russian people,” the statement said. President Joe Biden warned Monday about new indications of possible Russian cyberattacks, pumping up the volume on weeks of growing concern about a possible Kremlin-ordered response to crushing sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. The US is hunting down four alleged hackers it believes are involved in campaigns to compromise critical infrastructure worldwide. South Africa is apparently on the hackers’ list of targets.
