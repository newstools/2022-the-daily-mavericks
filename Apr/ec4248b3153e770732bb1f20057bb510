Woods said Sunday that he would be a “game-time decision” for competing at the Masters, which begins Thursday.

If he can walk around here in 72 holes, he’ll contend.” Woods is also known to have practiced at Augusta on Sunday and last Tuesday. –Field Level Media But an all-time high of eight South African’s, including past winners Charl Schwartzel and Trevor Immelman, will be determined to master “the thinking man’s golf course” and spoil the world number one’s return to form...
