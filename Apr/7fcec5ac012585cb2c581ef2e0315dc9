Monday 4 April is the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action. The theme for 2022 is “Safe Ground, Safe Steps, Safe Home”. The purpose of this day is to bring the achievements of the global mine action community to the fore, starting with the work of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, according to the United Nations (UN) information page on the occasion. “‘Safe Ground’ is the name of the global campaign ‘turning minefields into playing fields,’ which was launched by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 2019, and the concept of clearing the Earth of landmines and other explosive hazards to make it safe for development,” according to the UN. The concept of ‘Safe Steps’, meanwhile, refers not only to the trepidation that some people experience when they move about, due to the risk of detonating an explosive, but also to the procedures deminers use when working in mine-affected areas. ‘Safe Home’ is about “restoring the personal security of individuals and communities in post-conflict settings”, according to the UN. On Monday, 350.org will be launching its International People’s Platform for Climate Justice (IPCJ) — an online space in which the stories of resistance and people-powered solutions to climate change impacts will be shared. The International People’s Panel on Climate Justice, which is made up of activists, experts, academics and other stakeholders, will be leading the initiative. The platform and the stories it holds will show the human impact of climate change issues, as well as the power of people in finding and implementing solutions to these. The intention is to shift the narrative from one of despair to one of solidarity and hope. The IPCJ can be found here. At 8am on Monday, members of the People’s United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) have invited “all freedom-loving organisations” to stand in solidarity with those suffering in Swaziland in the form of a picket at the OR Tambo Building, 460 Soutpansberg Street, Pretoria. “The extra-ordinary troika summit comes at a time when the state security forces have resumed and escalated their brutality on peaceful protesters in Swaziland,” stated Pudemo’s press release on the matter. “The recent announcement by the prime minister, Mr Cleopas Dlamini, of an intent to hold the national dialogue appears to be both testing the waters, and a pre-emptive strike directed at subverting the SADC- [South African Development Community] led dialogue on the eve of extra-ordinary troika summit taking place on 4-5 April in South Africa.” Pudemo claims that King Mswati III of Swaziland is announcing a national dialogue on his own terms, independently of agreed-upon SADC processes. This, they said, is an affront to the well-intentioned process announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, chairperson of the SADC Troika, on 2 November 2021 after his visit to Swaziland. Those seeking more information on the picket can contact Lucky Lukhele, chairperson of Pudemo in the external region, on 081 458 5658. <img class="wp-image-1225347" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg 1080w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=480,480 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=350,350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> Later on Monday, at 2pm, Equal Education (EE) will be holding a Facebook live discussion titled, “Why a Mass Democratic Movement?” The discussion will centre on the importance of democratic movements led by young people. “We’ll be reflecting on what we’ve achieved the past three years, how our congresses are shaped and the learnings we can offer on movement building,” stated the event description.

Tuesday 5 April is the International Day of Conscience. In order to save future generations from the “scourge of war”, there needs to be transformation towards a culture of peace, according to the UN information page on the event. The UN declared 5 April the International Day of Conscience out of an awareness that there is a need to create conditions of stability, well-being and peaceful relations based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. “The General Assembly invited all Member States, organisations of the United Nations system and other international and regional organisations, as well as the private sector and civil society, including non-governmental organisations and individuals, to build the Culture of Peace with Love and Conscience in accordance with the culture and other appropriate circumstances or customs of their local, national and regional communities, including through quality education and public awareness-raising activities, thereby fostering sustainable development,” stated the UN. <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1225348" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg?resize=480,270 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MC-CWS-4April_3-Poster-2.jpg?resize=350,197 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> At 9am on Tuesday, there will be a colloquium on the sixth assessment report on climate mitigation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III.
