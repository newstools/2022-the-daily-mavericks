 Biden was asked if he would see himself personally sanctioning Putin if he invaded Ukraine. “Yes,” he said. “I would see that.” Biden also said he may move in the nearer term some of the 8,500 U.S. troops who have been put on stand-by, but vowed that no American troops would be deployed to Ukraine itself. The United States has generally refrained from imposing sanctions on the leaders of foreign countries. Then-President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in 2017 and on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2019. Biden told reporters he had stressed to Putin that “if he went into Ukraine there would be consequences.” (Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in a two-hour call on Tuesday that the U.S. would respond powerfully to an attack on Ukraine, according to the White House. The U.S. and European allies are weighing sanctions targeting Russia’s biggest banks and the country’s ability to convert rubles for dollars and other foreign currencies should President Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. President Barack Obama escalated U.S. economic sanctions against Russia on Tuesday for its aggression against Ukraine but dismissed suggestions the growing chill in U.S.-Russian relations marked the start of a new Cold War.
