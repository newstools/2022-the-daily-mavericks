Predominantly, learners experienced unprecedented learning losses, which will take ages to recover,” said Matsemela. Matsemela said a total of 41,081 North West candidates sat for the 2021 NSC examination. “In total, the number of candidates who achieved bachelor passes is 13,875 [33.8%], which is more than the previous year’s 11,820. The number of passes with a diploma is 10,794 [26.3 %], which is higher than the 9,983 of 2020,” said Matsemela. Matsemela added that 6,478 distinctions were achieved in the province in various subjects, “excluding life orientation”. The top three performing districts were as follows: Twenty-eight schools in the North West achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 NSC exams, while 216 schools obtained a pass rate of 80% and above, said Matsemela. Gimnasium High School was the top performing school in the province, with 214 subject distinctions, followed by Wesvalia High School with 207 distinctions, and Potchefstroom Girls’ High (186 distinctions).
