Oil and natural gas stocks were hit with a double whammy in early 2020 when lockdowns slashed energy demand and a short-lived supply war between Russia and Saudi Arabia pushed prices below zero. But a steady rebound in consumption and self-help measures such as cost cutting and debt reduction helped improve the outlook for crude producers. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 2.1% to $79.46 a barrel in New York on Thursday. Oil fell as U.S. President Joe Biden faced more calls to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to tackle surging gasoline prices and push back against consumer inflation running at the fastest pace in decades. President Joe Biden, battling the political consequences of the strongest inflationary surge in decades, has spent a good month trying to talk down the price of oil. And for now, it’s working. The main factor at play here is the price of fuel, as global oil prices have maintained a robust rebound from the rout of 2020 when some prices collapsed into negative territory.
