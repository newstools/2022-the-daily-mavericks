President Joe Biden will announce $316-million (R5.42-billion) in US aid for the Palestinians on Friday, as he seeks to revive US ties with the Palestinian Authority with a hospital visit and a meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas. The aid package will include as much as $100 million for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, subject to congressional approval, according to a senior administration official. Another $200 million will go to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, a programme that the US stopped funding under Donald Trump’s presidency, the official said.

Biden will also announce technological cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian teams working to build a 4G cellular network in Palestinian territories by the end of 2023.
