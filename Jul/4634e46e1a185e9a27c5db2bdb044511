Monday, 25 July is World Drowning Prevention Day. Drowning is a leading cause of accidental death, with about 236,000 people losing their lives this way each year worldwide. It is the third-leading cause of unintentional death, according to the United Nations. Low- and middle-income countries account for more than 90% of unintentional drowning deaths.

WHO, together with scientists and policymakers in affected countries, are working to understand the cause of this infection that does not appear to belong to any of the known five types of hepatitis viruses: A,B,C,D, and E,” the organisation said. This year, the focus is on “bringing hepatitis care closer to the primary health facilities and communities”, so that people have better access to treatment and care for the disease. “WHO aims to achieve hepatitis elimination by 2030.” On Thursday, at 10am, the Africa Criminal Justice Reform is launching a report on “Covid-19 restrictions and the impact on criminal justice and human rights – findings from five African countries”.
