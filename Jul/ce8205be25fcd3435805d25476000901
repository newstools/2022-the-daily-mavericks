Monday, 11 July is World Population Day. In 2011, the world reached a population of seven billion and will hit eight billion in 2022. While there have been advances in health that extended lifespans and reduced maternal and child mortality, as well as technological innovations, this progress is not universal. Inequality remains starkly evident, according to the United Nations: “The same concerns and challenges raised 11 years ago remain or have worsened: climate change, violence, discrimination. “Let no alarmist headline distract from the work at hand: investing in human and physical capital for inclusive, productive societies that uphold human and reproductive rights. Only then can we tackle the enormous challenges facing our planet and forge a world where health, dignity and education are rights and realities, not privileges and empty promises. In a world of eight billion, there must always be space for possibility.” <img data-lazy-fallback="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1321981" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_2-Poster1.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1019" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_2-Poster1.jpg 904w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=339,480 339w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=768,1087 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=706,1000 706w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_2-Poster1.jpg?resize=350,496 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> On Monday, 11 July, at 6.45am, a protest will take place outside the River Club site in Cape Town. Participants will meet at the TRUP Mound opposite Hartleyvale, on the corner of Liesbeek Parkway and Observatory Road. On Friday, 8 July, the Goringhaicona Khoi Khoin Indigenous Traditional Council and the Observatory Civic Association served the Liesbeek Leisure Property Trust (LLPT) and its five trustees with contempt-of-court papers as a result of the trust’s defiance of a court interdict issued on 18 March 2022. “[The] groundbreaking order, which noted that economic benefits can never override the fundamental rights of First Nations Peoples, expressly interdicted the LLPT ‘from undertaking any further construction, earthworks or other works on erf 151832, Observatory, Western Cape to implement the River Club development’ until the High Court reviews the relevant approval decisions,” according to a press release from the indigenous traditional council and the civic association. “We have asked that the case be heard as a matter of urgency given the LLPT’s determination to get as much concrete onto the site as possible before they have to answer to the High Court.” On Tuesday, 12 July, at 6.45am, protesters will gather again at the site, at the same meeting point. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1321982" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg 1200w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg?resize=480,480 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_3-Poster2.jpg?resize=350,350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> On Tuesday at 5.30pm, the Tshisimani Centre for Activist Education will host a public seminar on “‘July Unrest’: A year after the eruption”, following a preparatory session between 2pm and 5pm. “More than 350 people lost their lives in stampedes, clashes with police and attacks by military and vigilante groups in response to mass looting and the targeted burning of property,” according to the event description. “The conditions that helped produce these events remain the norm everywhere in South Africa.

The dialogue “specifically addresses goals three and 20 of Agenda 2063 and will focus on tackling Africa’s challenges on domestic resource mobilisation”. “This convention is premised on the fact that the Agenda 2063 aspirations and goals cannot be achieved without adequate financing and domestic resource mobilisation mechanisms in Africa. One key sector that could potentially provide adequate financing through optimal tax revenue collection is the extractive sector.” Register here. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1321983" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_4-Poster3.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="712" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_4-Poster3.jpg 750w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_4-Poster3.jpg?resize=480,475 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_4-Poster3.jpg?resize=720,712 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_4-Poster3.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MC-CSW-July11_4-Poster3.jpg?resize=350,346 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> On Wednesday at 5.30pm, there will be a community meeting on debt and credit in the Revival Family Church Hall, 1717 Mangope Avenue, Pampierstad, Northern Cape.
