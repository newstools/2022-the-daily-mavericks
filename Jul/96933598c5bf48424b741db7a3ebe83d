Heard’s legal team submitted the appeal notice to the Virginia Court of Appeals seeking to overturn a lower court’s June 1 ruling. Read full story After a six-week televised trial, a seven-person jury concluded that Heard defamed Depp and awarded the Pirates of the Caribbean star $10.35-million in damages. The jury also determined that Heard was defamed, awarding her $2-million. Heard’s team said it sought to ensure fairness and justice through the appeal. “We believe the court made errors that prevented a just and fair verdict consistent with the First Amendment,” a spokesperson said to Reuters. “We are therefore appealing the verdict.” The notice also appeals a June 24 final judgment order and a July 13 order against Heard’s post-trial motions. Lawyers for Depp did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The filing comes more than a week after a judge rejected Heard’s request for a new trial. In seeking the new trial, her lawyers argued that one of the jurors had served improperly. Read full story During the trial, Depp said he never hit or sexually abused Heard and argued that she was the one who became violent during their relationship.
