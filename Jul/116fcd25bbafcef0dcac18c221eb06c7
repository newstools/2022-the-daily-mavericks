“When is Daily Maverick getting an app?” “Have you guys ever thought about an app?” “I’ve got a great idea for you! How about a Daily Maverick app?!” Every day we receive suggestions like this into our inbox and, on occasion, in person at the school drop-off/ in the supermarket/ in restaurants/ on commutes… You get the picture. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1325906" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-14-at-15.43.12.png" alt="" width="720" height="537" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-14-at-15.43.12.png 1196w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-14-at-15.43.12.png?resize=480,358 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-14-at-15.43.12.png?resize=768,573 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-14-at-15.43.12.png?resize=720,537 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-14-at-15.43.12.png?resize=350,261 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> We love your passion. It is humbling that so many of our readers care about how they consume our news. Of course we want an app. The trouble is, apps cost money and we don’t have a big billionaire backer or piles of cash stashed in our couches. We also believe that the news should be free for everyone (regardless of their economic status), so we haven’t been able to rely on a paywall to force people to pay for the service we provide. And we never will. It’s a conundrum. We want an app. You want an app. That’s APParent (see what we did there?!) Currently only 0.26% of our readers voluntarily contribute to keep our journalism going as Maverick Insider members. That’s a tiny pool of people who are paying to keep you reading for free. It’s also the reason we don’t have an app yet. So here’s the deal: sign up to Maverick Insider, support our work and we’ll get you a Daily Maverick app. As an Insider, you’ll also get a host of other benefits. For example, if you sign up for R200, you’ll receive that right back every month in Uber Ride and Uber Eats vouchers. You’ll also get to browse ad-free, comment on our articles and get discounted tickets to our events. Let’s do it together. Or you can just keep reading for free. (Did we mention, we’ll never erect a paywall?) Want an app? So do we. Help us get there. Sign up here.
