Noah Lyles retained his 200m title as US sprinters secured their second podium sweep, while Shericka Jackson and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce made it a 1-2 finish for Jamaica in the women’s event at the World Athletics Championships on Thursday. Lyles, a bronze medallist at the Tokyo Games, scorched to victory in 19.31 seconds to become the third-fastest athlete of all time over the distance and break four-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson’s national record. Five days after Fred Kerley led a US 1-2-3 in the 100m, Lyles produced another dominant performance to clinch gold ahead of Tokyo runner-up Kenny Bednarek in 19.77, while teenager Erriyon Knighton finished third in 19.80. It is the first time a country has swept both men’s sprint events in the same year at the World Championships. Lyles led at the halfway point and exploded through the finish, with compatriots Bednarek and 18-year-old Knighton battling out of the turn and down the straight for silver and bronze.
