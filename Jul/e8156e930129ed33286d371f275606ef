The Bounty Brands stable consists of a basket of well-known consumer brands, including Diesel, Vans, Haägen-Dazs ice cream and Tuffy homeware products. It was founded by businessman Gary Shayne’s Coast2Coast Capital in 2014. By 2017, it held 12 businesses, or vendors, in its South African portfolio. It had also begun buying companies in Poland. Bountry Brands was essentially a holding company of which Coast2Coast had been the largest shareholder. Coast2Coast appointed Stefan Rabe (CEO) and Peter Spinks (CFO) to run the business. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1251886" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bounty-Brands-stable.jpg" alt="bounty brands" width="720" height="1577" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bounty-Brands-stable.jpg 900w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bounty-Brands-stable.jpg?resize=219,480 219w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bounty-Brands-stable.jpg?resize=768,1682 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bounty-Brands-stable.jpg?resize=457,1000 457w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bounty-Brands-stable.jpg?resize=701,1536 701w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bounty-Brands-stable.jpg?resize=350,767 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"  /> Also read: Zweli Mkhize’s R6m ‘cut’ from PIC’s R1.4bn deal using Unemployment Insurance Fund money
