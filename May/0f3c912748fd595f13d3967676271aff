Rotting human tissue is piling up at Gauteng hospitals as services are suspended over non-payment. The collapse in management is bringing what was once a ‘comprehensive healthcare system’ to its knees. David Makhura’s spokesperson says the SIU has been called in to investigate possible irregularities and corruption in tenders for the repair of Charlotte Maxeke hospital. Not so, says the SIU, which insists the hospital does not form part of any current probe.
