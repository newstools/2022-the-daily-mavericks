Thomas, who also won the tournament in 2017, said his caddy Jim “Bones” Mackay had put him back on track after carding a frustrating four-over 74 in the Saturday’s third round. “I’m fully confident in saying that I wouldn’t be standing here if he didn’t give me that — wasn’t necessarily a speech, but a talk, if you will,” said Thomas. “I felt like I’d played terrible. And he was just like, ‘Dude, you’ve got to be stop being so hard on yourself. You’re in contention every single week we’re playing.'” The 15-time PGA Tour winner has had Mackay, who caddied for 2021 winner Phil Mickelson for 25 years, on the bag since September and had six top-10 finishes in 2022 heading to Southern Hills Country Club. Thomas told reporters he was able to tune out the raucous crowds and avoid looking at the leaderboard on Sunday. “You don’t have to be perfect. Just don’t be hard on yourself. Just kind of let stuff happen, and everything is trending in the right direction. So just keep staying positive so that good stuff can happen,” he said. “There’s not very many times after shooting 4-over on Saturday of a major I left in as good a frame of mind as I have.”  (Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Peter Rutherford ) Defending champion Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods are among the 156 players entered in the field for the 2022 PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla. Men’s professional golf could be at a crossroads due to a new disruptor in the game. But the season’s second major is a chance for players to remember what makes the sport appealing. Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has recommended President Cyril Ramaphosa ‘consider’ Deputy State Security Minister Zizi Kodwa’s job after finding he was financially beholden to EOH’s Jehan Mackay, who faces a string of corruption allegations.
