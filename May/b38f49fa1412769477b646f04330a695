The Carrington will be their second City Centre endeavour in the last 12 months. Their previous track record boasts renowned developments such as The Tokyo, Newlands Peak, Rondebosch Oval, The Winchester, and The Premier. Last year, The Tokyo famously sold over 130 apartments on the first day, proving the move to the Cape Town City Centre was well-timed and justified for this predominantly southern suburbs developer. When asked about their goals for The Carrington​, Morne Moller, Director at Rawson Developers was confident about the team’s City Centre ambitions. “The Carrington promises to be a game-changer in well-priced, conveniently located, premium apartments with easy access to the amazing amenities and attractions that the cosmopolitan city of Cape Town has to offer.” The Carrington, delightfully repurposes and celebrates the rich and varied heritage of the existing building and its immediate surroundings. The 1950’s elegance of the facades and interior will be restored and enhanced with a fresh layer of charm and authentic style through cutting-edge best practices. The result is the magic and character of a 370-year-old city, combined with on-point 21st-century design and lifestyle features.  Nestled between the vibrant streets of Long and Bree. The Carrington is located in a sweet spot part of the City Centre, on the buzzing Loop Street. The area itself is a hotspot for dining, entertainment, shopping and sightseeing – with both locals and tourists enjoying the energetic city streets. As we emerge from the impact of the pandemic, there is a renewed energy in the city and there’s no doubt that the area will welcome this new addition. T​he Carrington consists of 49 luxury boutique studio apartments, a ground-floor restaurant and coffee shop, 24-hour concierge service, and a rooftop hosting a multitude of resident-only facilities. “​The Carrington​ provides investors with an amazing buy-to-let opportunity that caters perfectly to local residents and travellers alike. We hope that this repurposed beauty will continue to inject a renewed life force into one of our city’s tourism hotspots. With the expected completion date set for March 2023, before the UDZ cut-off time, investors would also be able to benefit from lucrative tax incentives.” With prices ranging from R1,190 000 to R1 890 000, this could be the perfect opportunity for both seasoned and first-time investors. What’s more, is that early investors can benefit from an R100 000 launch discount should they secure their apartment during the launch period. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1256096 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Carrington-Type-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Carrington-Type-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Carrington-Type-1.jpg?resize=480,360 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Carrington-Type-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Carrington-Type-1.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Carrington-Type-1.jpg?resize=350,263 350w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /> The Carrington fast facts: The Carrington’s interactive price list has recently gone live to the public meaning interested clients can easily browse and shortlist the available units with sales info, 3D renders, unit layouts and floor plans of each unit.

They and the City of Cape Town who grants land-use rights and requested departures have the opportunity to effect change and undo spatial apartheid. Either this or continue with business as usual… Cape Town is booming, with million-rand developments going up all over its centre. The city has been ranked as one of the top cities in the world for foreign direct investment: a feather in the cap of its investment arm, Wesgro. But tensions are mounting over what this development means… Activist organisation and law centre Ndifuna Ukwazi has launched litigation in the Cape High Court to compel the City of Cape Town to develop a housing policy that would require new developments to include affordable housing.
