The value of South Africa’s minerals production exceeded R1-trillion for the first time in 2021, the Minerals Council SA – the main mining industry body – said on Monday at the start of the Cape Town Mining Indaba. “The value of production was just shy of R1.2-trillion in 2021 and well above the R910-billion achieved in 2020. The boost in value was a result of improved commodity prices, which were 40% higher year on year in dollar terms and 20% higher in rand terms. A 12% firming of the rand against the dollar meant mining companies did not reap the full benefit of international commodity prices,” said the Minerals Council.

And things would have been a lot better were it not for the shambolic state of South Africa’s public infrastructure. The Minerals Council said that it “remains concerned about rail and port constraints, which it estimates resulted in an opportunity cost of R35-billion for 2021 based on railed tonnages compared to Transnet’s targeted tonnages. If the capacity of the rail network for bulk commodities like iron ore, coal and chrome is considered, the opportunity loss is R50-billion, a third of which would have flowed into the fiscus.” It also noted that raw production – as opposed to its value – had not recovered from its peak in the early 2000s and “is struggling to maintain 2015 levels”.
