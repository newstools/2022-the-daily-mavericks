The AFSIC 2022 agenda remains investment focused, with several of the most experienced and successful asset management firms investing in Africa sharing insights into where smart money is investing, and business leaders running some of Africa’s most exciting growth companies showcasing new investment opportunities, with focussed streams in Banking, Informed Investing, Building, Fintech Innovation, Sustainable Growth, Agriculture, and Power. With British International Investment and FSD Africa heading up an impressive group of supporting sponsors, the conference will also feature quickfire sessions showcasing a sample of the most interesting businesses listed on our Award-Winning AFSIC African Investments Dashboard which to date has attracted over 1000 investor ready projects. Structured regional country-specific investment summits are an exciting new addition to the AFSIC 2022 agenda. With the ASFIC team having built a trusted network of contacts through their Africa Business Community, interest in AFSIC attendance is high. Norsad Capital, Innpact and Divercity  are welcomed as new sponsors for 2022 and CEO, Rupert McCammon, is excited about the potential of AFSIC once again providing an exceptional opportunity to network with sessions offering unparalleled opportunities to develop strong business relationships with investors, financial intermediaries and African business leaders through an array of multiple presentation and panel streams, discussions, networking events, exhibition stands, business match-making meetings and seminars. Registration is now open and there are still a variety of exhibition and sponsorship opportunities on offer. Visit www.afsic.net or email event@afsic.net for more information. DM/BM
