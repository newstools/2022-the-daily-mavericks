The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index of Chinese firms trading in the U.S. jumped 7.6% on Thursday. Hong Kong’s tech gauge was up 3.6% as of 11:23 a.m., while the benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 2.8%. China’s CSI 300 Index climbed 0.6%. Still, traders remain wary that fresh virus outbreaks and Beijing’s adherence to a Covid Zero policy may roil further market upside. Any policy support may also be gradual, with Tencent Holdings Ltd. executives warning last week that it will take time for Beijing to act on promises to support the sector.
