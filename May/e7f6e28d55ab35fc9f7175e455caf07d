It is estimated that around 22% of the global population (1.3 billion people) currently use tobacco, yet data, as well as real-life experience, tell us that most smokers want to quit – aware that smoking negatively impacts their lives, health, and families. However, fewer than one in ten smokers succeed each year. We know that smoking is highly addictive, particularly because of the nicotine found in cigarettes. As with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin, nicotine activates the brain’s reward circuits. However, the effect of nicotine wears off quickly, leading people to feelings of withdrawal, such as irritability and anxiety. This motivates them to light up another cigarette, and so the cycle continues. People can quickly become addicted to smoking and suffer both physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms when they try to stop. The harmful effects of smoking on physical health are well known, including the substantial increase in the risk of developing lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a chronic lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe) and coronary heart disease, among others. Tobacco use is responsible for 8 million deaths each year worldwide, with 1.2 million of these being non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke. Many of us may not be aware of the relationship between smoking and mental health. While people are twice as likely to smoke if they have a mental illness, what is not commonly known is that smoking also increases mental illness symptoms, including for depression and anxiety. Additionally, having a mental illness may make it harder to stop smoking. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1278012 size-medium" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?w=480" alt="" width="480" height="443" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png 1668w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?resize=480,443 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?resize=768,709 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?resize=720,664 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?resize=1536,1417 1536w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?resize=1280,1181 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?resize=1600,1476 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Flexible-goals_Tobacco_large.png?resize=350,323 350w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /> Understanding that professional support and proven cessation interventions can significantly improve a smoker’s chance of successful quitting, Discovery Vitality has searched for a viable solution to help tackle the addiction to nicotine, one that is powerful in its use of technology, psychology and pharmacology to help people quit.
