Africa’s most industrialized nation was already on track to exceed the annual record for energy shed from controlled blackouts, a practice locally known as loadshedding that’s used to prevent the grid from a total collapse. There were 1,054 gigawatt hours cut through April versus 2,521 in the entire year earlier, itself a record, according to a report by the state-owned Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The crisis surrounding Eskom, which generates almost all the nation’s electricity including 80% from burning coal, causes disruption to both daily life in South Africa and economic activity. The ongoing outages have increased pressure on Chief Executive Officer Andre de Ruyter, while government programs to build new generation have faced various delays. Beyond the operational issues, the utility has a massive debt pile and the distraction of an ongoing reorganization. Phillip Dukashe, Eskom’s group executive for generation, quit on Monday after 26 years at the company. Eskom and the government are also working on plans to utilize $8.5 billion of funding pledged at the COP26 climate summit with the aim of moving South Africa away from coal. –With assistance from Rene Vollgraaff. The world will keenly watch how South Africa uses the chunk of cash from rich nations to move away from coal and focus on green hydrogen and electric cars – not forgetting Eskom’s debt – says the man heading the talks on the deal. The troika of Eskom CEO, board chairperson and Pravin Gordhan is insufficient firepower for the crisis. Eskom executives hope Stage 6 power cuts will not be necessary as cold weather and rain increase demand.
