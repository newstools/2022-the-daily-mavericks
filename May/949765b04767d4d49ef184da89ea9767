Tuesday, 3 May is World Press Freedom Day. The 2022 theme for the day is “Journalism Under Digital Siege”. The theme is intended to highlight the multiple ways in which surveillance and digitally mediated attacks endanger journalists and journalism, according to the United Nations (UN) information page on the event. The latest United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) World Trends Report Insights discussion paper, Threats that Silence: Trends in the Safety of Journalists, shows that surveillance and hacking are compromising journalists. “Surveillance can expose information gathered by journalists, including from whistle-blowers, and violates the principle of source protection, which is universally considered a prerequisite for freedom of the media and is enshrined in UN Resolutions,” stated the UN. “Surveillance may also harm the safety of journalists by disclosing sensitive private information, which could be used for arbitrary judicial harassment or attack.” The observance of World Press Freedom Day reminds governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom, according to the UN. The day further serves as an opportunity to celebrate the fundamental principles of press freedom, assess the state of press freedom around the world and pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty. On Tuesday, 3 May at 11am, the Hanns Seidel Foundation, with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), is hosting a seminar titled “Police reform is about officers, not just institutions”. Panellists at the discussion will explore the meaning of police work in a society marred by inequality and violence. They will discuss the reforms that can address problems related to the police as an institution and the individuals that form part of it. The chairperson for the discussion is Dr Andrew Faull, a senior researcher for justice and violence prevention at the ISS. Speakers include Rofhiwa Maneta, a freelance journalist and author of A Man, a Fire, a Corpse, and Ziyanda Stuurman, the author of Can We Be Safe? The Future of Policing in South Africa.

DM/MC The commemoration of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May prompts us to assess the state of press freedom in South Africa and compare it with other countries in the region and worldwide. Like a slow tsunami, South African newsrooms are shrivelling due to retrenchments. Ahead of Black Wednesday/Media Freedom Day, I will shine the spotlight on the usual threats to media freedom, but the more important question must be asked: if journalists all but disappear, whose freedoms are we worrying about protecting?… This article is Part One in a three-part series relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impacts on freedom of expression and media freedom. Part One focuses on censorship of the media; Part Two will deal with access to online platforms in an age of cyber-warfare; and Part…
