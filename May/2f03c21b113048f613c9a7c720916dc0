Scholz has faced intense pressure over his hesitancy to supply advanced weapons systems to counter Russia’s invasion.

Bei der #DGB-Kundgebung zum #TagderArbeit in #Düsseldorf verteidigte #Bundeskanzler Olaf #Scholz die beschlossenen #Waffenlieferungen in die #Ukraine – unter Pfiffen und Buhrufen. https://t.co/YAIbR2SQSg pic.twitter.com/06BWI9PnkY — BR24 (@BR24) May 1, 2022 Scholz’s ruling coalition is discussing Russia’s war against Ukraine and its consequences for the German economy at a two-day cabinet retreat north of Berlin. No imminent decision over sending more weapons to Ukraine was expected during the meeting, said one of the officials. Germany’s military capabilities have been hampered by years of limited funding, and military leaders have warned that sending howitzers could weaken the country’s defenses. The Bundeswehr has 119 PzH 2000s, but only 40 are currently operational, according to newspaper Die Welt, which earlier reported the government’s plans. Kirkegaard said the concerns of Germany’s military leaders that the weapons deliveries could weaken the country’s own defense capabilities were “absurd” as the artillery would be used to defend not only Ukraine, but also Europe as a whole. The Netherlands is already sending the PzH 2000, and Germany has offered to supply ammunition and training for the system, which can fire nine rounds a minute at targets as far as 30 kilometers (19 miles) away.
