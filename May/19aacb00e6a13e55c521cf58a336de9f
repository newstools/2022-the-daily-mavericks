South Korea’s IPO market has cooled this year, despite the successful debut of battery maker LG Energy Solution in January, with a series of companies canceling plans to float amid a broader market slump. Conglomerate SK Group delayed plans to list its battery unit and an app market operator, while builder Hyundai Engineering & Construction withdrew its IPO. Shares of Samsung Publishing Co, which held almost 17% of Pinkfong as of the end of November, surged by the daily limit of 30% on Wednesday on the IPO speculation. The stock then plunged 13% on Thursday after Pinkfong Chief Executive Officer Kim Minseok posted a comment on Facebook saying “how come this journalist is aware of an IPO plan that I don’t know?” The stock rose as much as 6.7% in early trading Friday before paring gains.
