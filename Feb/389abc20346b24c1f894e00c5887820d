Titled “Fix and Open Charlotte Maxeke Hospital Now (part 2)”, this is the second picket to be held outside the hospital. It calls Gauteng Premier David Makhura to effectively respond to a memorandum demanding the urgent reopening of critical wards. It demands procurement transparency for the hospital’s repair work. “It is incumbent on us – residents of Johannesburg – to build momentum in demanding the reopening of critical wards. Far too many patients remain on waiting lists to receive the necessary healthcare. Thirty percent of the hospital remains closed. Despite the oncology unit being opened, reports indicate waiting lists of about 2000 patients,” the organisers said. Staff at surrounding hospitals are coming under severe strain as patients who cannot be catered for at Charlotte Maxeke are diverted elsewhere. While the Premier announced interventions to fast track the opening of the hospital, those impacted need an action plan with timelines. Register your attendance here
