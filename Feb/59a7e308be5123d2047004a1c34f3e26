The government has pledged to raise this to 36% by 2036. With much of the country covered by desert, Botswana is suitable for solar projects. Concentrated solar power projects use lenses or mirrors to focus a large area of sunlight onto a receiver. It is a more expensive technology than photovoltaic solar power.
