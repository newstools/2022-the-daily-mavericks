My nation is World Peace
My people wait for bombs in Kyiv’s subway,
My friends shudder in Belgrade’s shelters
My mothers cry for kidnapped daughters
My fathers’ sons vanished on the way
My brothers’ pain refuses to cease My yells are multiplying, it’s electrifying
My deaths are on twitter, screams spottified
My ends are tik-toked, my children terrified
My morques are multiplying, Electrifying! My days are running away, like thieves
My ends are nearer than my beginnings
My dreams end @ Mar-a-Lago, Kremlin, Nkandla.
You were always so bloody right, My Cassandra. My nation is World Peace.
I am nationless.
