The largest Japanese automaker said it is “experiencing multiple dropped logistics routes across the supply base, so it’s not isolated to only one or two parts at this point,” after the protests snarled traffic between the United States and Canada. Toyota’s production of the RAV4, RAV4 hybrid, Camry, Avalon, Lexus RX and Lexus ES are currently impacted. (Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chris Reese) Never say things can’t get any worse, Toyota’s managers are probably reminding themselves these days. The world’s biggest car manufacturer is now considering issuing a worldwide recall of its sales flagship, the Corolla. Back in the 1990s, the first Toyota RAV4 was a diminutive lifestyle machine, akin to Suzuki’s Jimny in size, but less utilitarian in execution. Five generations later, the latest RAV4 has become much larger and much fancier. Does it have the right stuff to tackle a tough segment, though? Toyota Motor Corp said on Monday it would halt production at all of its car assembly plants in Japan from Feb. 8 to Feb. 13 due to a steel shortage following an explosion at a steel plant operated by one of its affiliates.
