The measures, which came after virus cases doubled nationwide to nearly 3,400, extend restrictions placed earlier on the city’s central business district. The surge in infections is thought to be linked to the neighbouring city of Hong Kong, where about 300,000 people are currently in isolation or under home quarantine. Alongside the lockdown, Shenzhen will launch three rounds of mass testing of residents. All bus and subway systems across the city were ordered to shut down during the restrictions. Businesses, except those providing essential services, will also close, and employees will work from home if they can. Residents will be barred from leaving the city, except in limited situations, and they will need to produce a negative Covid test within 24 hours, AFP said. Hong Kong says about 300,000 people in isolation or quarantine Hong Kong reported more than 32,000 new Covid cases and 190 deaths, health official Dr Albert Au said at a briefing.

New cases include 13,335 confirmed by nucleic acid tests and 19,095 by rapid antigen tests. The city recorded 190 new Covid deaths, aged 39 to 105 years old, and 101 patients are in intensive care units, Hospital Authority Chief Manager Dr Sara Ho said. There were also 74 “backlogged” fatalities. About 300,000 people in Hong Kong are currently in isolation or under home quarantine, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press conference on Sunday.
