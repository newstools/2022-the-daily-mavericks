In a statement, the centre did not directly address Google’s report but said: “We see malicious cyber activity on a daily basis.” President Vladimir Putin delivered a robust defence of Russia's actions in Crimea on Tuesday and said he would use force in Ukraine only as a last resort, easing market fears that East-West tension over the former Soviet republic could lead to war.
