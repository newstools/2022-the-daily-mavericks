NielsenIQ South Africa managing director Ged Nooy says: “South Africa has clearly returned to a time of austerity shopping, much like that experienced during and after World War 2.” He says there is no doubt that the events in Ukraine will affect the rest of the world in terms of increased inflation, given the impact on the oil price and the agricultural sector. Ukraine supplies 10% of global wheat exports (UN Food and Agricultural Organisation), which often sees it described as the “breadbasket of Europe”. About 60% of the top consumer goods product categories experienced price increases ahead of consumer price inflation (CPI) during the fourth quarter of last year, according to a NielsenIQ study of consumer price increases using South African Retailer Measurement service data. The NielsenIQ data also show that almost half (48%) of the top consumer goods categories – including meat and dairy products, beverages and household cleaning items – which generate almost 80% of sales, saw an average pack price increase of between 5% and 11%  year on year, while 9% of top consumer goods categories saw a leap in pack prices well beyond 11%. These increases are a notch above inflation, which is currently sitting at 5.7%, and consumers can expect to see fatter increases ahead. “There is a general acceptance that the cost of goods sold will continue to be higher this year and we have to recognise that we are in a hypersensitive consumer environment where Covid has accelerated the polarisation of consumer finances, leading to new trade-offs we haven’t seen before,” says Nooy. Shoppers could have been forgiven for spluttering with outrage at the 25% increase in the price of cooking oil, although this essential purchase stayed in trolleys regardless of cost. However, South Africans have been buying less frozen chicken after an average R14.75 price increase on the protein, and bacon that costs more than R40 for a 250g packet is now officially a luxury.

Within this pressure cooker of prices, something has to give, and it seems as if certain meat products such as those mentioned above, are already being excluded from shopper baskets as a result,” says Nooy. “The key lesson is to be aware of shifting channel dynamics and consumer preferences in inflationary environments. Whether consumers change their consumption, stock up or downsize, manufacturers and retailers should not lose sight of the nuanced ways different channels can fulfil consumer needs,” he concludes. BM/DM Analysts predict that the conflict will have myriad unhappy consequences for SA’s embattled economy. Here’s what to expect. The good maize production in South Africa this year gives a short window to plan for the next El Niño which will mean severe droughts for the region, and to build resilient regional food production to guard against global changes. By supporting production across the eastern and southern Africa region,… The combined effect of the severe drought and the depreciation of the rand drove annual food inflation to 9.8% in March, its highest level in four years. Periods of high food inflation often spark an outpouring of concern over its impact on the poor. By PATRICK KELLY.
