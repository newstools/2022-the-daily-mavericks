Burhan is tightening his grip after taking power in a coup in October, reversing appointments made by civilian leadership during a two-year power-sharing period. In a statement, the head of the board of governors for the University of Khartoum, Sudan’s most prominent university, described Burhan’s decisions as illegal and encroaching on powers held by the prime minister. Professors at Sudan University, one of the largest, said they would begin an open-ended strike in protest. Military leaders have yet to appoint a prime minister since the resignation of Abdalla Hamdok in January following a brief return to office. Universities have been a hotbed for student protests, and university presidents had been involved in mediation attempts between the military and civilian groups. (Bloomberg) --Sudan’s military tightened its grip on state institutions and arrested hundreds of opponents, dampening hopes the African nation’s democratic transition can be put back on track after last month’s coup. CAIRO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Thursday named a new transitional council, headed by himself, to lead the country following the military takeover late last month, shrugging off domestic and international pressure to reverse the coup. Sudan's principle protest group has demanded the immediate formation of a civilian-led government to replace the country's new ruling military council, warning that the demonstrators' "revolution" is at threat from "the remnants of the regime" of deposed leader Omar al-Bashir .
