Bitcoin had spent the past few days mired in the tightest trading range since October 2020, a phenomenon some market watchers ascribed to long-term holders stepping in to buy whenever the token dips. Meanwhile, selling by short-term investors has kept Bitcoin and other digital assets from mounting sustainable gains. Bitcoin dropped then spiked and dropped again in Wednesday morning trading. The pattern looked familiar to fans of America’s favorite lemon-toned television family. Bitcoin climbed to a fresh 2019 high, approaching the $6,000 level for the first time since November. Bitcoin is headed for the biggest gain since April, providing some welcome relief to battered cryptocurrency investors -- but it may be too soon to call a bottom.
