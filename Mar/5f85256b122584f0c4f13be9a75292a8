Their departure comes hours after Prosecutor Karim Khan announced he would start collecting evidence as part of a formal investigation launched after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. “Yesterday I formulated a team and today they are moving to the region,” Khan said. Khan said his office would be examining possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by all parties in the conflict. While Ukraine is not a member of the ICC, it signed a declaration in 2014 giving the court jurisdiction over alleged grave crimes committed on its territory from 2014 onwards regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators. Russia does not recognise the court. (Reporting by Anthony Deutsch;Editing by Alison Williams, William Maclean) THE HAGUE, March 5 (Reuters) - Judges at the International Criminal Court on Thursday ruled that an investigation into alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan by the Taliban, Afghan military and U.S. forces may proceed. Russia said Wednesday it is formally withdrawing its signature from the founding statute of the International Criminal Court, saying the tribunal has failed to live up to the hopes of the international community. With the African Union set to discuss a Kenyan-backed proposal to cut ties with the International Criminal Court this week, there is a renewed vigour in the debate about the International Criminal Court’s apparent bias towards Africa.
