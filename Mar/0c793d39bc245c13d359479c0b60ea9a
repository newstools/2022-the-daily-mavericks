This online group, organised by psychologist and Sadag board member Shai Friedland, will be held twice a month. For more information on how to sign up, email ownmindhealth@gmail.com. Tuesday, 8 March is International Women’s Day, an opportunity to claim “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow”, according to the United Nations. The organisation considers the advancement of gender equality in the context of the climate crisis and disaster risk reduction one of the greatest global challenges of the 21st century – particularly as women are increasingly recognised as being more vulnerable to climate change impacts than men. This vulnerability stems from the fact that women make up the majority of the world’s low-income population, with greater dependency on the natural resources that climate change threatens. Having women involved in sustainability initiatives results in more effective climate action. They make “powerful leaders and change-makers for climate adaptation and mitigation”, according to the UN. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1198561" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg 1200w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg?resize=480,480 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_6.jpg?resize=350,350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" />On Tuesday afternoon, the Tshisimani Centre for Activist Education will hold a virtual activist discussion with the theme “Democracy on the brink?” A preparatory session will run from 2pm to 5pm, while the public seminar will take place between 5.30pm and 7.30pm. The discussion seeks to explore how nearly three decades of democracy in South Africa have coexisted with “rampant inequality, rising poverty, unbridled corruption, brutal exploitation and the erosion of ordinary people’s living standards through the commodification and hollowing-out of public services”, according to Tshisimani. Those involved will be considering possibilities for the future. The seminar will be livestreamed on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. Those who wish to participate in person must RSVP to info@tshisimani.org.za by Monday, 7 March. The discussion will take place at Bertha House, 67 Main Road, Mowbray. From Wednesday, 9 March at 9am, an International Summit on the Protection of Whistleblowers will take place at the Capital Hotel in Melrose, Johannesburg. The event, themed “Situational Analysis – Reflections on legal and institutional frameworks (national and international)”, will run until 11 March. It is being hosted by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC). The conference is intended to allow consultative engagement with key stakeholders on the present state of protection for whistle-blowers in South Africa, so as to begin exploring the reforms needed in legal and institutional frameworks underlying whistle-blower protections. On the first day of the conference, speakers will address delegates and participants. Advocate Bongani Majola, chairperson of SAHRC, will deliver the opening address. On days two and three, delegates will take part in closed working groups to review national legal and institutional frameworks, identifying gaps and proposing reforms. Thursday, 10 March is the first annual International Day of Women Judges – a day to promote the equal participation of women at all levels of the judiciary, according to the UN. It is also an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made in this area, while raising awareness of the challenges that lie ahead. Women are significantly underrepresented in decision-making positions, including judicial and senior judicial leadership positions. However, their representation is vital in ensuring that courts address the concerns of citizens and hand down sound judgments. “By marking the day, we will reaffirm our commitment to develop and implement appropriate and effective national strategies and plans for the advancement of women in judicial justice systems and institutions at the leadership, managerial and other levels,” said the UN. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1198560" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="407" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg 1858w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg?resize=480,271 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg?resize=720,407 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg?resize=1600,904 1600w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-7March_5.jpg?resize=350,198 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" />On Thursday at 12pm, the University of Cape Town (UCT) School of Public Health and Family Medicine (SPHFM) will be hosting a seminar on “Covid-19: work, economic activity and the spatiotemporal distribution of infection in South Africa”.
