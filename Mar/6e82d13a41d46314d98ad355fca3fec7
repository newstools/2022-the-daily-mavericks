The reason that most people choose not to build an investment portfolio is because they think they need to be wealthy to do so, but that’s not true. “You begin with as little R500 to start building your diversified portfolio. You just have to know where to start,” explains Chris Beamish, Investment Manager at Cape Town-based Revix. Investing during times of conflict adds its own layer of risk and makes conservative investing more important than ever. With the world uncertain of what will happen next, your investment strategy could use its own line of defense. No matter where you are in the world, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is going to affect your investments. But this isn’t the time to be hiding your money under the mattress. Uncertain times brings about opportunity, being savvy with your money now will help you weather the storm and gain security during uncertain times. Luckily, there are safe-haven investments that are able to fortify your wealth. Investing in gold during times like these offers more than just positive returns in the long term, they solve unexpected issues that arise in times of crisis. Investing during volatile times can be difficult because of the increased unpredictability: Firstly, conflict causes disruptions to a country’s ability to produce goods and services. These disruptions generally cause a knock-on effect that leads to goods and services becoming more expensive — this is known as inflation. 

Secondly, conflict is expensive. Billions get spent on funding the military with weapons and machinery. A government will risk debt over defeat so it’s the taxpayers who have to shoulder the cost. It’s not time to panic, it’s time to be a smart investor. You can use this knowledge to position your portfolio in a way that protects you from harm but also helps you benefit from any potential upside. In safe-havens. Safe-havens are investments that maintain or increase in value during times of market uncertainty. Even during turbulent times in the world, these assets hold strong and provide the security your portfolio needs to weather the storm. Gold is one of the most favoured choices because of its proven credentials as a wealth protector. Throughout history, few investments have rivaled gold in popularity as a hedge against almost any kind of trouble, from inflation and economic upheaval to currency fluctuations and war. Gold has historically been seen by investors as the “go-to” in terms of safe-haven assets. There’s an old saying in investing: “Own gold and hope it doesn’t go up.” When gold’s on the rise, everything else (like stocks, property, etc.) is most likely going down. The precious metal has not just survived bear markets, after all, it has thrived in them. As shown below, gold has outperformed most traditional assets in times of uncertainty. This was most noticeable during the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 when gold shot up 25%, against 18% for the S&P 500 (a gauge of the US stock market) and 8% for US Treasuries (debt that the US government has and is viewed as generally very low risk). <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1202572 size-full" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crisis-investing_Graph1.png" alt="" width="512" height="411" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crisis-investing_Graph1.png 512w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crisis-investing_Graph1.png?resize=480,385 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crisis-investing_Graph1.png?resize=350,281 350w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /> With the uncertainty over Russia and Ukraine, this time is no different. We have already seen gold is up over 10% this year, while the S&P 500 is currently down -11%. Simply put: investing in a safe-haven asset like gold is the safe choice when there is conflict in the world. The drawback of investing in physical gold bars is that they are expensive to store, secure and insure against loss. Plus, unless you are paying the tab with a gold bar, they aren’t exactly mobile. Luckily this centuries-old investment has gone through a contemporary evolution with Paxos Gold (PAXG). You can invest in gold through Paxos Gold (PAXG), a US regulated and insured ounce of physical gold that sits on a blockchain. PAX Gold is for anyone looking to invest directly in gold without the custody and insurance burdens of physical ownership. One PAXG token is backed by one fine troy ounce of the highest quality gold stored in high-security, fully insured vaults. When you buy one whole PAXG token or a fraction of a PAXG token, you’re buying the legal ownership right to an ounce, or a fraction of an ounce, of a physical gold bar. It’s like buying a stock where you have legal ownership even though you don’t physically hold or look after the company itself. It’s one of the benefits that blockchains bring to investing — lower costs, greater efficiency and more security.

This couldn’t be truer for Bitcoin itself, with even the worst possible buy in Bitcoin generating a minimum return… Vladimir Putin’s decision for Russia to invade Ukraine sent shockwaves through investment markets. Stocks, oil, crypto, and every other investment category are seeing sharp changes in price — something that is known as price volatility. Gold has outperformed Bitcoin and the S&P 500 by over 5% this year.
