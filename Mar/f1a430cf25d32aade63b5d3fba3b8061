 Sidwell Mayekiso started the 2 Knights Chess Club in Khayelitsha in 2017. Living with a disability, he wanted to make a difference in the community by teaching children to play chess. Now, five of his students are competing in the Western Cape provincial trials. He hopes that one day one of his students will become a Grandmaster.
