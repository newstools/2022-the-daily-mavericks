On Monday 28 March at 10am, a petitions public hearing will take place in Tshwane. It will be an opportunity for the Gauteng legislature’s chairperson of the Standing Committee on Petitions, Hon. Ezra Letsoalo, to resolve adopted yet unresolved service-delivery-related petitions. These petitions will cover a range of issues from housing development projects to land requests to speed control issues. By fast-tracking the resolutions of the petitions, the committee aims to address service delivery challenges in the area while also improving the capacity of the provincial government and municipalities to fulfil their mandates. “It is important for Gauteng communities to know their right to petition the Provincial Government and municipalities and are thus entitled to having their grievances attended to. Platforms must be created for residents to be involved in matters that concern them and their communities and hold authorities to account — not merely during the electioneering period but also beyond,” said Letsoala on the petitions process. The public hearing will take place at Mzansi Resorts, Molefe Makinta Road, Mabopane Unit U. The event can be watched live on YouTube or Facebook. At 10am in Bisho, Eastern Cape, activists will be gathering at the Bisho Massacre Memorial as part of the Inyanda National Land Movement’s “Water Rights Campaign March”. The march, which will end at the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) offices, serves to launch a campaign to respond to the poor provision of water, unsafe drinking water, lack of water for small-scale farmers and deteriorating water infrastructure in the Eastern Cape. A list of the activists’ demands will be handed over to Xolile Nqatha, MEC of Cogta. On Monday at 11am, Media Monitoring Africa in partnership with the Goethe-Institut Johannesburg, the German embassy and the Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen will host a masterclass session providing a “Media Freedom, Digital Warfare Deep Dive”. The session will involve the sharing of a range of perspectives and an exploration of the key issues around limitations of freedom of expression and media freedom during times of conflict. The experts taking part in the session are Markus Beckedahl, founder and editor-in-chief of netzpolitik.org and co-founder of re:publica, and Avani Singh, independent legal consultant and digital rights specialist.

Later on Monday, at 4pm, the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research will be holding an online seminar on “The Archive Machine: The Truth Commission and the Archaeology of Apartheid”, presented by Jacob Dlamini. The paper being presented seeks to show that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was an archive machine — a mechanism by which new possible lines of historical inquiry were made. It “set the conditions for the posing of new questions about the past” and helped many gain a better understanding of apartheid while conceptualising new futures, according to the paper’s abstract. “In what follows, I aim to present the TRC as an archive machine, a device that sought (and succeeded more than its critics are prepared to acknowledge) to make possible new lines of historical inquiry, to set the conditions for the posing of new questions about the past, and to help many gain a better understanding of apartheid while imagining new futures.” Those wishing to attend the session should first read the paper here.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently approved revisions of its recommendation 24, which has resulted in a new global standard on beneficial ownership transparency. This has the potential to allow South Africa, a FATF member, to escalate its efforts against corruption. Government, the private sector and civil society stakeholders will be able to come together as part of this webinar, to critically discuss the problem of beneficial ownership opacity in South Africa. The speakers for the event are Maira Martini Cherese Thakur of amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism; Maira Martini of Transparency International; Joy Waruguru Ndubai of the Institute for Austrian and International Tax Law; and Karabo Rajuili of Open Ownership. They will be discussing the FATF amendments in order to explore the various possibilities for moving the anti-corruption and transparency agenda forward.

Later on Thursday, at 1pm, a webinar titled “War and food: How will the Russia-Ukraine conflict affect African food systems?” will be hosted by the Institute of Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (Plaas). “Russia and Ukraine are among the top ten global producers and exporters of wheat and other cereals. The rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine is likely to affect African countries, as exports of wheat, maize, sunflower oil and fertilisers from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are interrupted, likely for a prolonged period,” according to the event description. This situation, in combination with other crises, makes it important to understand African countries’ changing food systems and how to make them resilient. The speakers for the event include Prof Steve Wiggins, research fellow at Overseas Development Institute in the United Kingdom, and Refiloe Joala, Food Sovereignty Programme Manager at Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung and a PhD candidate at Plaas. Prof Ruth Hall from Plaas at the University of the Western Cape will be chairing the discussion.

Saturday 2 April is World Autism Awareness Day. While major progress has been made towards increasing access to education for persons with autism over the past decade, the Covid-19 pandemic has reversed years of progress by disrupting learning. “Many students with autism have been especially hard hit and studies show that they have been disproportionately affected by disruptions to routines, as well as services and supports that they rely on,” stated the United Nations (UN) information page on World Autism Awareness Day. At 4pm on Saturday, there will be a webinar on “Inclusive Quality Education for All”. The event is organised by the UN Department of Global Communications and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, in partnership with civil society organisations such as Autistic Self Advocacy Network, the Global Autism Project and the Specialisterne Foundation. The observance of World Autism Awareness Day will therefore involve a panel discussion on inclusive education as the key to the transformative promise of the Sustainable Development Goals to leave no one behind, according to the United Nations.
