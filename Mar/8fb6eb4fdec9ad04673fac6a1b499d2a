 Woods reportedly flew to Augusta and walked the course with his son, Charlie, and Justin Thomas. It was his first practice round at Augusta since suffering major injuries to his right leg in a car accident nearly 14 months ago.

Woods has said that he intends to return to the PGA Tour, however he has declined to provide a specific timetable. “You’ll see me on the PGA Tour, I just don’t know when,” Woods told CBS’ Jim Nantz at the Genesis Invitational last month. “I’d love to tell you that I’ll be playing next week, but I don’t know when. “It’s frustrating in that sense, because I’ve been down this road before with my back when I didn’t know when I was going to come back. It’s hard, because it’s hard not to have goals out there — you know, ‘I want to play this event so I can set myself up for that mentally and physically and emotionally.’ I don’t have any of those dates in my head. I don’t know yet.” SportsBetting.ag is offering odds on whether Woods will indeed tee it up next week: -250 that he will vs. +200 that he will not. The sportsbook said that indicates a 71.43 percent probability that Woods will at least tee off in the first round. Offered at +5000 at SportsBetting.ag, the sportsbook said Woods “easily” has drawn the most support of any player in the field with 12.8 percent of the outright winner handle. But an all-time high of eight South African’s, including past winners Charl Schwartzel and Trevor Immelman, will be determined to master “the thinking man’s golf course” and spoil the world number one’s return to form... Oh, and the field also includes the likes of Rory McIlroy, back on song with… Brooks Koepka, holding his nerve to fight off dramatic challenges from Tiger Woods and Adam Scott, won a thrilling back-nine battle Sunday to capture the 100th PGA Championship. Sergio Garcia and surprise package Marc Leishman seized joint control in Thursday's opening round at the Masters, though tournament favourite Tiger Woods was lurking just four shots off the pace.
