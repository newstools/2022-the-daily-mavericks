Anti-Racism Week kicks off on Monday, 14 March. The Anti-Racism Network South Africa – currently coordinated by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation and the Centre for Advancement of Non-Racialism and Democracy – is encouraging all sectors of society to get involved in the week and host self-initiated activities. The 2022 theme for Anti-Racism Week is “UNITE and ACT against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerances”. It culminates in Human Rights Day and the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 21 March. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1205685" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_2.jpg 400w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_2.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_2.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_2.jpg?resize=350,350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /> The Anti-Racism Network South Africa advocates for all South Africans to unite against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerances. Suggested activities for the week include workplace discussion forums, school assemblies, community dialogues and sports tournaments dedicated to anti-racism. “Activations can be small or large gatherings. The only request that we make is for you to share information of such activations so that we can assist with publicity and other material if needed. This information is also needed to indicate the scale and reach of anti-racism work during the week as well as the resources that might be available from various organisations which others can possibly use to strengthen their work,” the Anti-Racism Network said. If you are interested in attending Anti-Racism Week activities hosted by organisations affiliated with the network, call 011 854 0082 for further details. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1205684" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg 1080w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg?resize=480,480 480w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_1.jpg?resize=350,350 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> At 5.30pm on Monday, the Centre for Environmental Rights, in partnership with the African Climate Alliance, will host an online workshop to understand the Climate Change Bill.

The permit’s expiration in December 2021 has affected between 182,000 and 250,000 Zimbabweans living in South Africa, according to the event organisers. A 12-month grace period in which permit holders can apply for other permits appropriate to their situation, began on 25 November 2021. Those who do not acquire another permit in this period will have to leave South Africa or face deportation. The country has seen a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment and xenophobic attacks in recent months. Movements such as #PutSouthAfricansFirst and Operation Dudula, as well as some political parties, have advocated an anti-foreigner stance. Those interested in engaging with these issues in the public dialogue can do so here. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1205692" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_7.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1019" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_7.jpg 1157w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_7.jpg?resize=339,480 339w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_7.jpg?resize=768,1087 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_7.jpg?resize=706,1000 706w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_7.jpg?resize=1085,1536 1085w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_7.jpg?resize=350,496 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> At 1pm on Tuesday, the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) will host a live Facebook question-and-answer session to mark World Social Work Day.

A series of exhibitions and stalls known as the Activism Village will allow social justice organisations to interact directly with visitors, stimulating public debates and dialogue, according to Constitution Hill. Apart from debates and dialogue, there will also be exhibitions of poetry, dance, music, film and visual art. The arts play an important role creating a culture of human rights, according to Constitution Hill. “[C]onstitution Hill is built on two pillars, art and justice. This brings together those two components,” said Dawn Robertson, chief executive of Constitution Hill. “We honestly believe that creativity and creatives and young people are going to be the change that we require in South Africa. And that’s what we hope to bring together on the hill for the festival.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1205696" src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_10.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1018" srcset="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_10.jpg 1131w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_10.jpg?resize=340,480 340w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_10.jpg?resize=768,1086 768w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_10.jpg?resize=707,1000 707w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_10.jpg?resize=1086,1536 1086w, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MC-CSW-14March_10.jpg?resize=350,495 350w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> On Monday, 21 March – National Human Rights Day – there will be two marches against xenophobia.
